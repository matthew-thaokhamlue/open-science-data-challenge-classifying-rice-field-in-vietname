# open science data challenge classifying rice field in vietname

# **Project Description**

This repository contains a a weekend fun project inspired by the EY Open Science Data Challenge, which aims to address the issue of world hunger using data science. With over 800 million people suffering from severe hunger and climate change exacerbating the problem, there is an opportunity to leverage the poIr of data to make a difference in world food production.

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to detect rice-growing regions using Sentinel-1 radar data. Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world's population and is essential to the livelihoods of millions of individuals. HoIver, the amount of land suitable for rice cultivation is decreasing, and yields are not increasing fast enough to meet demand.

To tackle this problem, I focused on using radar data to identify areas where rice is grown in Vietnam, as a first step towards understanding and addressing the challenges facing rice production. I explored the use of geo-coordinations, VH, and VV polarization as input features for a binary random forest classification model.

Vietnam was chosen as the focus of this study because it is a major producer of rice, and more than half of the calories consumed by the Vietnamese people come from rice. Additionally, Vietnam is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which could cost the nation $10 billion by 2020, according to the World Bank.

Rice provides a livelihood for one-fifth of the world's population and is a staple food for over four billion people. Irrigated rice yields in developing countries are expected to decline by 15% due to climate change, despite a decrease in both the amount of land available for rice cultivation and the yield growth rate.

Therefore, focusing on solutions for rice production, particularly in Vietnam, could have a significant impact on global rice output, making it a necessary and strategic decision.
